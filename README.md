## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Another excellent practice prompt from Frontend Mentor. I had the opportunity to use regex (albeit very basically) to change up the url path of specific images based on viewport width. 

I had a little bit of difficulty spacing and configuring the navigation bar to display as close as possible to the design but I believe I got close enough to it by utilizing flexbox and margins. 

My javascript betrays my need to not repeat myself but for now, my current solutions works and does what I need it to do :)
